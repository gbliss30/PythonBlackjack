# PythonBlackjack
A moderately simple implementation of Blackjack!

The goal of this project is to create a simulated game in which you can learn both Blackjack basic strategy, as well as learn how to count cards while not losing your money to Vegas. :P

The deck is populated by however many decks you wish to play with. The decks are shuffled together, cards are drawn from the front of the deck, and returned to the back.

The dealer hits to 17, and the two main actions (hit and stand) have been implemented. A future implementation will deal with splitting, double downs, insurance, as well as an optional 'basic strategy mode' to assist the player in determining what the best course of action is.

A future version may also include another player or two who implement basic strategy as well.
